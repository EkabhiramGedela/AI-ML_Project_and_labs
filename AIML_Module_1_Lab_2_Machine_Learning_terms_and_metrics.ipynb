There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "\n",
        "Ans:Yes, averaging the validation accuracy across multiple splits  give more consistent and reliable results because Averaging across many different random splits reduces the effect of any single bad split.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Does it give more accurate estimate of test accuracy?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:yes beacuse  model performs consistently across many validation splits, it’s likely to generalize well to unseen data\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the effect of the number of iterations on the estimate? Do we get a better estimate with higher iterations?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Yes, increasing the number of iterations\n",
        "it improve the quality of the estimate.estimate of the model’s true performance becomes more stable and reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Consider the results you got for the previous questions. Can we deal with a very small train dataset or validation dataset by increasing the iterations?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:If your training set is too small, the model won't learn meaningful patterns.Repeating training on small data doesn't improve learning\n",
